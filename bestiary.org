* Demons and their uses
Various Demons appear throughout Shin Origami Tensei. The only thing common
among them is their habitat, the souls of Sinners, and a single element of
their appearance--namely, the fact that all Demons appear as if they are
wrought of paper, moving like cut-out dolls pasted on the surface of reality.
Below is a list of some of the Demons that you may use in your adventures.
This list is, naturally, spoilers. Don't read it unless you are a GM or you
like to cheat at video games. They are sorted according to their weakness for
ease of use in encounter design.
