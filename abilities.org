Abilities are the core of character sheets in Burnt Paper Soul, and they can be created (mostly) without the GM's assistance, through this set of simple rules.

* Active Abilities
Active abilities have a *cost*. This cost is determined by what the ability does, as follows:
** Damage
- Damage: +1 point per point of damage
- Elemental Type (other than Physical): +1
** Buffs/Debuffs
- Adding a positive effect to a friendly target: +2 points, +1 per additional turn
- Adding a negative effect to an enemy target: +2 points, +1 per additional turn
- Adding a positive effect to an enemy target: -1 points, -1 per additional turn
- Adding a negative effect to yourself: -1 points, -1 per additional turn
- Adding a Strange effect to any target: +1 points, +1 per additional turn
** Conditionals
- Add a token to targets: +1 point
- If: Reduce cost of all things affected by an "If"
  statement by 1/2 
- X: The cost of an X is equal to 2 of whatever it would've replaced (i.e.,
  "Deal X damage" is treated as "Deal 2 Damage" for costs)
** Healing
- Healing: +1, and an additional +1 per health regained
** Self-Damage
- Damage Self: -1 per point of damage
- Take damage equal to your HP minus 1: -3
- KO Self: 1/4 cost
** Target
- Single Target: x1 (base cost)
- Multi Target, Conditional (i.e., "One of each type of enemy" or "All enemies which have a ____ token"): x2 points
- All Target (i.e., "all enemies"): x3 points

Any multiplier or divider is applied at the *end* of cost calculations, after all addition and subtraction.
For instance, an ability which does 3 Elemental damage (+4), self-inflicting Guard Break for 1 turn (-2), 
and hits all enemies (x3) would have a cost equal to (4-2)*3, or 6 Meter. Abilities always have a cost of at least 1.

* A note on If and X
One of the most important parts of this system is the *"If"*. If is a
powerful tool, which allows you to trade general usage of an ability 
for lower cost (or higher damage). A simple example would be this ability:
- Power Attack: Deal 1 Elemental damage to a target. If the target is Knocked Down, deal 2
  Elemental damage to it.
The first part of the ability is a standard ability; it does 1 damage, of an
elemental type, to one target. It would cost two Meter to cast, if it stopped
there. However, the part immediately following "If" is *conditional*--it only
happens "If the target is Knocked Down".

*Everything within that sentence costs half as much as it would otherwise, rounded down.*

Thus, the ability costs 3 Meter to cast--2 for the first part, and (2 divided
by 2) 1 for the second part. However, the second part only triggers if the
target is knocked down, so the ability is less useful against targets who
haven't been knocked down.

This becomes far more useful when you introduce Tokens. Consider this
ability:
- Road Flare: Add a Mark token to a target.
It costs 1 Meter and does nothing on its own. Now consider this other
ability:
- Artillery: Deal 1 Elemental damage to all targets which have a Mark token.
It costs 4 Meter (2 for Elemental damage, times 2 for multi-target on a condition.), 
where an ability that just targets all and hits for 1 damage would cost 6 Meter 
(4 for all target, 2 for Elemental damage). By offloading the extra cost onto a token ability,
you get a cheaper version of a powerful ability (at the cost of an extra slot).

One final thing to consider: Using an X in your ability. You'll notice that
in the above rules, things with X in them are treated as if you replaced the
X with a 2. But in combat, you can replace X with anything you can count, by
adding the line "Where X is equal to (thing to replace X with)":
- Against the Odds: Deal X Elemental damage to one target, where X is the
  amount of damage you've taken
- Lightning Rod: Deal X Elemental damage to one target, where X is the number
  of Charge tokens they have.
- Lingering Will: Add X turns of Depression to one target, where X is the
  number of Willpower tokens you have.
By combining Tokens, Ifs, and Xs, you can create a wide variety of abilities
that are specialized and unique.

* Passive Abilities
Passive abilities use a similar cost scale to Active abilities, with a few key differences:
- They have an additional base cost of 2, added to the cost of the ability (before multipliers, of course).
- Instead of being *activated*, they are *triggered* by a conditional. The trigger for a passive ability does not halve its cost.

Passive abilities can trigger on many different conditions, such as damage to yourself, damage of a certain elemental type, 
or anything else that can be used in a conditional. The only exception is that *you cannot use passives to modify your basic attack*.
Passives which use your own basic attack as a conditional are not allowed.
