Abilities are the core of character sheets in Burnt Paper Soul, and they can be created (mostly) without the GM's assistance, through this set of simple rules.

* Active Abilities
Active abilities have a *cost*. This cost is determined by what the ability does, as follows:
** Target
- Single Target: +0 points
- Multi Target, Conditional (i.e., "all of the same type"): +2 points
- All Target (i.e., "all enemies"): +4 points
** Damage
- Physical Damage: +1 point per point of damage
- Elemental Damage: +1, and an additional +1 per point of damage 
** Buffs/Debuffs
- Adding an effect to a target: +2 points, +1 per additional turn
** Conditionals
- Add a token to targets: +1 point
- If: Reduce cost of all things affected by an "If"
  statement by 1/2 
- X: The cost of an X is equal to 2 of whatever it would've replaced (i.e.,
  "Deal X damage" is treated as "Deal 2 Damage" for costs)
** Healing
- Healing: +1, and an additional +1 per health regained

* A note on If and X
One of the most important parts of this system is the *"If"*. If is a
powerful tool, which allows you to trade general usage of an ability 
for lower cost (or higher damage). A simple example would be this ability:
- Power Attack: Deal 1 Elemental damage to a target. If the target is Knocked Down, deal 2
  Elemental damage to it.
The first part of the ability is a standard ability; it does 1 damage, of an
elemental type, to one target. It would cost two Meter to cast, if it stopped
there. However, the part immediately following "If" is *conditional*--it only
happens "If the target is Knocked Down".

*Everything within that sentence costs half as much as it would otherwise.*

Thus, the ability costs 3 Meter to cast--2 for the first part, and (2 divided
by 2) 1 for the second part. However, the second part only triggers if the
target is knocked down, so the ability is less useful against targets who
haven't been knocked down.

This becomes far more useful when you introduce Tokens. Consider this
ability:
- Road Flare: Add a Mark token to a target.
It costs 1 Meter and does nothing on its own. Now consider this other
ability:
- Artillery: Deal 1 Elemental damage to all targets which have a Mark token.
It costs 4 Meter (2 for multi target on a condition, 2 for Elemental damage), 
where an ability that just targets all and hits for 1 damage would cost 6 Meter 
(4 for all target, 2 for Elemental damage). By offloading the extra cost onto a token ability,
you get a cheaper version of a powerful ability (at the cost of an extra slot).

One final thing to consider: Using an X in your ability. You'll notice that
in the above rules, things with X in them are treated as if you replaced the
X with a 2. But in combat, you can replace X with anything you can count, by
adding the line "Where X is equal to (thing to replace X with)":
- Against the Odds: Deal X Elemental damage to one target, where X is the
  amount of damage you've taken
- Lightning Rod: Deal X Elemental damage to one target, where X is the number
  of Charge tokens they have.
- Lingering Will: Add X turns of Depression to one target, where X is the
  number of Willpower tokens you have.
By combining Tokens, Ifs, and Xs, you can create a wide variety of abilities
that are specialized and unique.
