# Shin Origami Tensei
## Welcome to the Velvet Gaming Table.
This game is about fighting your inner demons and becoming stronger as a person. It's a deterministic game, where each choice is important, and your friends are your power. It might be about the end of the world, but you'll probably be trying to change that.

## Where to look
* rules.org is the file that contains the base rules. Look here to learn how to make a character and fight alongside other Sinners.
* status.org lists the status effects that you might run into. These range from classic heal-over-time and damage boost effects, to strange things like Half-Time and Offset.
* bestiary.org is a list of monsters. This is for GMs.
